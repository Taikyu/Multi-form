## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library



### What I learned

I used this challenge to focus mostly on understanding some react hooks (i.e useContext() and useReducer()).


### Continued development

Currently taking a react course on [Udemy](https://udemy.com). and will continue to use this platform to improve.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me research JS methods and functions. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Tailwind Docs](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - The best place to learn about Tailwind. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
